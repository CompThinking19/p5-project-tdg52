This project was simply created to challenge the user in an entertaining manner. 
Through figuring out the maze, not only will the user find mental stimulation, but they'll also be have some fun with it.
Personally, the idea behind it was to create something that the user an interact with.
That's where the line drawing came into play - the user can visually keep track of their movements without having to remember it all in their head.
Given the entertainment platform, it wasn't made to be complicated.
This code is really something the user can just engage in and enjoy in their free time.
